# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques. Various preprocessing steps such as handling imbalanced data (SMOTE, RandomUnderSampler), feature selection (RFE), and outlier removal (Z-score) were applied to improve model performance.
